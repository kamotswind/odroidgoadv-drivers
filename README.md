# odroidgoadv-drivers
Additional kernel drivers for the ODROID-GO Advance

Each driver is separate and may have different compile methods.
All will require the kernel headers which should be standard on the official OS image.
You may need to install the build-essential package, among other packages, to compile these drivers.
This file will be updated with build instructions for each driver package.
